About My App: 

I designed an interactive interview app that streamlines the process of conducting interviews and storing responses. The app allows users to record interviewees’ answers using speech-to-text functionality and stores the data in a TinyDB database for easy retrieval. Features include question navigation, answer recording, a date picker for interview scheduling, and the ability to clear or review the stored database. The user-friendly interface ensures a seamless interview experience, while built-in notifications confirm data actions like resetting the database.
